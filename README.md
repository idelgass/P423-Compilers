# P423-Compilers
Work from my Compilers course taken at IU Bloomington Fall 2023.  

The goal of the course was to write a compiler for a limited version of the python language. Features include basic integer math and storage, register allocation, conditionals, loops, and tuples. Functions were added later, but broke certain aspects of local testing and so were not included here.

This was a group project, based off of support code given by our professor. The majority of our work on the compiler itself can be found in compiler.py. I wrote a large portion of this file, but do not claim to have written the entireity of the file.
