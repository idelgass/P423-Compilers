# P423-Compilers
Work from my Compilers course taken at IU Bloomington Fall 2023
This was a group project, based off of templates given by our professor. The majority of our work on the compiler itself can be found in compiler.py. I wrote a large portion of this file, but do not claim to have written the entireity of the file.
